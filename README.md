# Description of the Assignment

- what song we chose
- how many visuals we have
- what do visuals do
- mention processing + minim

# Instructions

- how we use buttons to move through parts
- space restart

# How it works

- how we created dev branch -> treated it as master (incase of issues) and made branches from there
- each of us have our own sections talking about what we coded + how + insert pics of it (can include code too if you want)
- mention how we combined our workings together

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Roxana Pohodnicaru: 
This is the first big collaborative coding project I’ve worked and I can definitely say that I learned a lot from this experience. 
I encountered a  number of issues when I started this project because I had very little knowledge of Java or Processing. In overcoming these difficulties, I’ve become more confident and improved my coding skills. I discovered that the combination of Java and Processing is fun to experiment with.
I also enjoyed the collaborative aspect of this project. We were all open to share ideas and feedback with one another. The constructive criticism we gave each other helped us improve as programmers but also as individuals.
I feel happy with the way the project evolved.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
