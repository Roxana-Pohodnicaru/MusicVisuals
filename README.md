# Description of the Assignment

- what song we chose
- how many visuals we have
- what do visuals do
- mention processing + minim

# Instructions

- how we use buttons to move through parts
- space restart

# How it works

- how we created dev branch -> treated it as master (incase of issues) and made branches from there
- each of us have our own sections talking about what we coded + how + insert pics of it (can include code too if you want)
- mention how we combined our workings together

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Stephanie Ifeoma Ogu: The component of this assignment that I am first have to say that we used our knowledge from classes about Java processing to get much more to make this amazing project.  During the work, I have learned a lot. I  was able to solidify our learning and apply my understanding of Java processing in real-world scenarios, and complete a large project.

And secondly, I proud of was the team teamwork. Despite having a busy semester, we were still able to collaborate well on this assignment. Setting deadlines and establishing separate channels of communication helped us to operate methodically and successfully. It was remarkable to witness how we helped one another, worked together to tackle challenging issues, and united our efforts. We used the different strengths that each member of our team possessed to get beyond mistakes and roadblocks. I improved my interpersonal abilities via this assignment, which will be helpful for future team initiatives. Overall, I am pleased with the work.

Nikka May Omo: This assignment has me achieve a significant progress in my learning journey for this module. I am most proud of the growth in terms of teamwork and learning more about how to visualise our creative ideas using processing. I was able to become productive and fulfill the deadline we set up thanks to our strict planning and frequent meetings. 

As a student who was worried at the start, I can confidently conclude I am satisfied with the work I contributed. I think the key achievement is that we were able to leverage each other's strengths and overcome any errors that arose during the project. This not only led to a successful outcome but also help me develop interpersonal skills that will serve me well in other future projects.

Roxana Pohodnicaru: 
This is the first big collaborative coding project I’ve worked and I can definitely say that I learned a lot from this experience. 
I encountered a  number of issues when I started this project because I had very little knowledge of Java or Processing. In overcoming these difficulties, I’ve become more confident and improved my coding skills. I discovered that the combination of Java and Processing is fun to experiment with.

I also enjoyed the collaborative aspect of this project. We were all open to share ideas and feedback with one another. The constructive criticism we gave each other helped us improve as programmers but also as individuals.

I feel happy with the way the project evolved.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
